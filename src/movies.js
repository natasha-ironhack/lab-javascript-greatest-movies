//Go ahead and create a function named getAllDirectors() that 
//receives an array of movies as an argument and returns a new (mapped array).

const movies = require("./data");

// How could you "clean" a bit this array and make it unified (without duplicates)?

//movie.director);

//the array so we can have only the drama movies where Steven Spielberg is the director.

//These are the best movies based on their scores, so supposedly all of them have a remarkable score. 
//In this iteration, we want to know the average score of all of them and display it on the console.

using the title key. However, in this case, we only need to print the title
